 when the first interstellar tocht succeeds. 
The first space haven outside the Solar System is established in the Beta Centauri star system.
The harbour planetary star is officially named Majestico. This is a brown dwarf. 
This involuntary tocht triggers a rescue operation. 
For further details, search on keywords: Ekstasia, Majestico space haven or Drotner starship. 
Corollary: Faster-than-light travels tampers with time. 
Anno Domini 2060, Integra initiates a trial scheme of using star time on its ships.
For more information, see Vari.
Search in the Archive on keyword: Vari, brief excerpts: 
1 Vari is approximately 1000 earth-days. 
A Vari can be divided into 25 spatia; each spatium consists of 40 days. 
When the last spatium has less than 40 days, it is called an epagomene. This epagomene can be used to synchronize time across planets and spaceships. An epagomene can be shorter than forty days â€“ never longer.
